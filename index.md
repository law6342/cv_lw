## SUMMARY
My research focuses on understanding how environmental conditions impact microbial behavior and  pathogenic  potential  relevant  to  human  health.  I  have investigated  microbial  traits  such  as biofilm formation, stress tolerance, antimicrobial resistance, and cell signaling that contribute to disease. In my graduate studies, I aim to further explore how these microbial behaviors impact human physiology and apply this knowledge toward the development of therapeutic interventions.

## VOLUNTEERING & ACTIVITIES
Biomedical Engineering Society Treasurer (2022-2024): I worked to uphold the club’s mission of holding research seminars during general meetings, promoting collaboration between the College of  Engineering  and  the  College  of  Arts  and  Sciences,  and  participating  in  community  outreach STEAM  events  with  local  elementary  schools.  As  the  treasurer,  I  managed  the  club’s  budget tracking income and expenses and prepared financial reports to discuss with members. Through
collaboration with the Student Government Association, I facilitated timely reimbursements for club members,  ensuring  efficient  transactions.  I  led  in  organizing  on-campus  events  using  allocated funds to recruit new members and boost morale of current club members.

Chemistry Club (2023-2024): As a founding member of the chemistry club, we worked to
share knowledge to students interested in the chemistry field and getting involved in research. As a club, we hosted open house nights where we ran basic chemistry experiments to provide students with an introduction to the research process. Field trips within the club included traveling to laboratories within the state of Florida and participating in chemistry related research.

Medi-Futures Virtual Shadowing (2023-2024): Obtained 40 virtual shadowing hours to
network with healthcare professionals and expand my knowledge on clinical research.
Graduate and Transfer Admissions Assistant (March-October 2024): Shared knowledge
regarding degree programs, admissions guidelines, and general inquiries through phone calls, cases, emails, and tasks.

Protecting Animal Wellness Society (2021-2023): While living on campus, I helped take care of Embry-Riddle’s feral cat population by assisting with the weekly feeding schedule and monitoring their health. We implemented a trap, spay/neuter, and release program to effectively manage the population. I took part in fundraising efforts to collect money for vet fees.

Alpha Epsilon Delta Honor Society (2023-2024): Selected for membership based on academic
excellence in the Aerospace Physiology major. I am an active member, engaging in as many
volunteering opportunities within the organization as possible including assistance with events such as Science Olympiad and Girls on the Run.
