## Introduction

After completing my undergraduate degree and beginning my graduate studies at Penn State, I decided it was time to create a professional website to showcase my CV and share my thoughts through blog posts. This first post documents the process of building this site.

## Why Quarto?

I chose [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Quarto makes it easy to create websites from markdown files without dealing with complex web frameworks
2. **Scientific Publishing**: As a researcher, Quarto's strong support for scientific writing, equations, and citations is invaluable
3. **Built-in Blog Support**: The blog functionality comes out of the box with listings, RSS feeds, and categories
4. **Flexibility**: I can easily add more pages, customize the design, and extend functionality as needed

## The Build Process

### Setting Up the Structure

The website consists of a few key files:

- `_quarto.yml`: The main configuration file that defines the site structure and appearance
- `index.qmd`: My CV, serving as the homepage
- `blog.qmd`: The blog listing page
- `posts/`: Directory containing all blog posts

### Configuration

In `_quarto.yml`, I configured:

- A navigation bar with links to Home and Blog
- The Cosmo theme for a clean, professional look
- Custom CSS for additional styling

### GitHub Pages Deployment

To automate deployment, I set up GitHub Actions to:

1. Build the Quarto site whenever I push to the main branch
2. Deploy the generated site to GitHub Pages
3. Make the site accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

The workflow handles all the dependencies and rendering automatically, so I can focus on writing content.

## What's Next?

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I plan to:

- Share insights from my research in microbiology and space science
- Document my graduate school journey
- Write about technical topics I'm learning
- Provide resources for other students in STEM

## Technical Details

For those interested in the technical setup:

- **Platform**: Quarto
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **Markdown Flavor**: Quarto Markdown (supports LaTeX, code blocks, and more)

The entire source code for this website is available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com), and you can use it as a template for your own site.

## Conclusion

Building this website was a great learning experience and a practical way to apply technical skills outside the lab. If you're a researcher or student considering creating your own site, I highly recommend giving Quarto a try!
